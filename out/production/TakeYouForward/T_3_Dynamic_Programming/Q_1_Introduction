Concepts of Dynamic programming

1) There are two approaches of DP - A) Tabulation -  Bottom-up DP
                                    B) Memoization - Top-Down DP

2) Memoization Technique - it is the technique that tend to store the value of sub-problems in a map or table.
3) Tabulation Technique -  moving from base case to the required answer.

4) Converting a recursion to DP solution -
        1. Initialize a n+1 size dp array
        2. identify returning value
        3. put a check if dp[n]!=-1 then return dp[n]

5) Identifying the DP Problem -> 1) Count the total number of ways
                                 2) Multiple ways of doing something- Min or Max output

6) Shortcut trick for recurrence relation -> 1) Try to bring the problem into index
                                             2) Do all the possible stuffs to that index
                                             3) if count all ways- sum up all the stuffs
                                                if min/max of all - find min/max
