1) Types of Graph - A) Directed Graph - direction is specified.
                    B) UnDirected Graph - direction is not specified.
2) Two components of graphs are - Node and Edges.
3) Cycles in graphs - if starting from a node you can reach that node again, then a graph contains cycle.
4) Path - It contains a lot of nodes with each node is reachable.
5) Degree of a node - It is the number of attached edges to that node.
6) Total Degree of a graph - 2 * (Total number of edges in a graph).
7) In-degree of a node - The number of incoming edges in a node.
8) Out-degree of a node - The number of outgoing edges of a node.
9) Edge Weight - Sometimes edges are also given a weight.
